# Getting Started 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start
At the beginning, to run RestAPI we need to install it with the following command:

`npm i -g json-server`

Then we run the terminal following commands to run:

`json-server --watch db.json`

In the next step, we run our application through commands on new terminal window:

`npm run start`

If you wanna run tests use:

`npm run test`
